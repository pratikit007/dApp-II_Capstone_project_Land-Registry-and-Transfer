# dApp-II_Capstone_project - Land-On-Block

This project is submission of  BCDV1014 - dApp II individual assignment developed by  [Pratik Patel](https://github.com/pratikit007) under the guidance of professors **_Dave Mckay_** & **_Dhruvin Parikh_** as a part of [Blockchain Development - Fintech](https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/blockchain-development-program-t175) course at [George Brown College.  
](https://www.georgebrown.ca/)

In brief, it is a Blockchain solution for Land registry and transfer, using Ethereum, Node.js and ReactJS. For more details about project, please refer to [Documents](https://github.com/pratikit007/dAppI-Group_Project-COVID-19_Vaccine_Supply_Chain/tree/master/Documents) document.


## Business use case

Real estate, be it a plot of land or commercial building, has always been the most extensive product of human creative activity, as well as the most obvious form of material value. Undoubtedly, it has been considered as of great social, economic and political importance in each country. Land-On-Block is a blockchain based solution for Land registry and transfer. This idea has been coined for the countries where land records are recorded manually and on-paper which creates lots of problem for citizens. This application simply helps users to check the information about their land details at the tips of their fingers. 


## Why blockchain required?

Blockchain is one of the most talked about technologies in recent years, especially within the IT community and the financial services industry. However, it’s inherent nature of creating trust has attracted so many industries and Real estate is one of them.  For countries without a trustworthy real estate ownership record and land registry, a similar project is very essential, cost efficient and fastest way to create transparent and trustable land records. The functionality of Blockchain can be described as a digital ledger. It mainly serves the same functionalities as a sound Land Registry system because it knows who owns what at a certain time. It ensures single-ownership and it captures when a certain transaction took place. It is possible to ‘trace back’ and therefore it should be possible to guarantee title.

## What blockchain to use?

In this use case I have decided to use Ethereum blockchain. Considering the choice of platform, the public permissioned blockchain based on Ethereum seems to be a reasonable solution since it supports smart contracts and provides development tools and libraries. Since user can access their land records easily on public blockchain and smart contracts logics are efficient to develop the logic for land transfer, Ethereum becomes a good choice for this application. In other words, with smart contracts enabling self-execution when certain conditions are met transactions could be completed faster.  However, it can be extended to Hyperledger Fabric as well when limited authorization required to be given to some participating nodes such as Buyer, Seller, Broker and more power to be given to specific nodes such as Government land registry department, Judicial system and others. 


## Scope of project

This capstone project has limited scope limited to the overall design of the application and fundamental architecture of the same. It covers the bottlenecks, benefits as well. It is in early developments phase where idea has been coined create this solution based on foundation knowledge of Blockchain. However, in order to make it more scalable and flexible where various scenarios and complexity can be accommodated with the contribution from blockchain expert community.
